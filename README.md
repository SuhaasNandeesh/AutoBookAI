# AutoBook AI

AutoBook AI is a website that uses AI agents to fully automate scheduling based on user preferences. It handles everything from availability checks to confirmations and conflict resolution, making scheduling invisible and effortless.

## The Problem

The hassle of scheduling life's routine tasks—doctor visits, restaurant reservations, haircuts, vet appointments, or even virtual meetings—wastes hours weekly, causes stress, and leads to missed opportunities. Current solutions are reactive or limited to specific categories.

## The Solution

AutoBook AI is a proactive, autonomous scheduling assistant. It's designed to be:

- **Simple:** One-time setup, then it runs autonomously.
- **Integrated:** Works across different services and categories.
- **Global:** Multilingual and location-aware.
- **Easy to Use:** A simple, chat-based interface.

## How It's Built

This project is a showcase of AI-driven development. It is being built entirely using AI tools, with no traditional coding or development teams. We are leveraging the following technologies:

- **LangChain & LangGraph:** For building and orchestrating our AI agents.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** To provide our agents with the necessary context and knowledge to make intelligent decisions.
- **LLMs (Large Language Models):** As the core reasoning engines for our agents.

## Project Status

This project is currently in the initial development phase. We are focused on building the core architecture and a functional MVP.

## Contributing

As this project is being developed by an AI, traditional contributions are not applicable. However, feedback and suggestions are welcome.
